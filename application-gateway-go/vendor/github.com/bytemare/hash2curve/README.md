Package hash2curve provides hash-to-curve compatible hashing over arbitrary input.
It implements the expanders and hashing to a field as specified in [hash-to-curve](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-irtf-cfrg-hash-to-curve/).

#### What is hash2curve?

> Hashing to curve allows representing arbitrary byte sequences as points on a curve (or elements in a group), therefore
> benefiting from interesting mathematical properties very useful in cryptographic protocols, like CPace, VOPRF, and
> OPAQUE.
